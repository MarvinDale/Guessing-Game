# Guessing-Game
This game is implement using binary tree classes.
Every internal node is a yes or no question. Yes, brings you down the left side and no brings you down the right side.
Every leaf node in the tree is a guess at what the user was thinking. 
If the user gets to a leaf node that guesses the wrong answer the user must provide what the actual answer was, 
and they must provide a new yes or no question which will distinguish the guessed answer from
the users answer. These additions to the tree can be saved and loaded at a later point.
